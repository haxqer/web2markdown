# Privacy Policy for Web2Markdown

## Introduction
Web2Markdown is a browser extension that converts web page content to Markdown format. This privacy policy explains what information Web2Markdown collects and how it is used.

## Single Purpose Statement
Web2Markdown serves a single, narrow purpose: to convert the content of the current webpage into Markdown format, allowing users to save and use web content in a standardized text format.

## Data Collection
Web2Markdown does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers. All processing happens locally within your browser.

## Permission Usage

### activeTab Permission
The `activeTab` permission is used to access the content of the currently active tab when the user explicitly activates the extension. This allows Web2Markdown to read the webpage content for conversion to Markdown format.

### scripting Permission
The `scripting` permission allows the extension to execute scripts in the context of web pages. This is necessary to extract and process the content of the current webpage for accurate Markdown conversion.

### storage Permission
The `storage` permission is used to save user preferences and settings locally in the browser. No user data is transmitted to external servers.

### downloads Permission
The `downloads` permission enables users to save the generated Markdown content as a file directly to their device. This permission is essential for the core functionality of exporting web content as Markdown files.

## Host Permissions
Web2Markdown requests access to all URLs (`<all_urls>`) to function on any website the user chooses to convert to Markdown. The extension only activates when explicitly triggered by the user and only accesses the currently active tab.

## Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party services or analytics tools.

## Updates to Privacy Policy
This privacy policy may be updated occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in this document.
